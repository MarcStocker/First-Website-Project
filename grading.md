Log into Admin account for full functionality

Recipes page can be located on the Header, or at the bottom of front page. 

Search bar on front page and Recipes page can search for Ingredients, key works in recipes, description, and recipe title. Searching an empty string will display all recipes.

As admin:
Viewing a recipe will allow you to edit/delete it. 
On the edit menu, you may preview a new image you would like to upload without having to reload page/upload the file directly.

On header there is an admin dropdown control panel, on it you will find:
1. Add a new recipe
2. Edit homepage details
3. Admin webpage

I added an edit homepage on the admin menu to allow Edgar the ability to change his about me details and the 2 pictures that are displayed on the front of the homepage.

On the header there is also a little dropdown "Follow me" button that provides links to both his Instagram and his Facebook. 
Upon being clicked, these will open up new tabs so that you can continue browsing his personal webpage, and also take a look at his social media. 


I hope that covers just about eveyrthing.
