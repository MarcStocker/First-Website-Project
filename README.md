# Marc's First Website
This is the final project for Chico's CINS-465 Web development class, with Bryan Dixon.

This website will implement Python3 and Django as the backend. 
Of course other languages such as HTML, CSS and JS will be used for the front end.

The purpose of this website is to build a foundation for a personal website for my friend Edgar (Instagram name: EdgarRaw) to upload and keep track of his recipes, also allowing his Instagram followers to visit his page and look up specific recipes.

## Scope
Unsure of what the entire scope will be at this point.
At the moment my current plans are to imlpement a user system so Edgar can log in and edit recipes, and to create a search system using tags, or regex to allow users (both signed in and not) to search for recipes with key words/ingrediants



This readme will be edited as I figure out the route I plan on going with the project.
